# Heart-Disease-Predictor
We are applying different machine learning models to predict whether an individual has an heart disease

We have taken the raw system output file and preprocessed ,trained and compared the following models
1. Extra trees classifier
2. Random forest classifier
3. Decision trees
4. SVM classifier
5. Multiplayer perceptron with hyperparameter tuning (hidden layer size) using genetic algorithm

# Conclusion
It can be seen that Multiplayer perceptron had the highest accuracy.
